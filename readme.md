<h1> Gym Locator </h1>
<p>This project aims to create health awareness by helping people know their BMI and how to take the next step in getting fit. </p>
<p>They can find listed gyms in the map which would show them the address and operating hours.</p>
<p> Alternatively, if travelling to their nearby gym is not possible, there are also home options for users to start their fitness journey </p>

<h1> UX </h1>

<p> This project was created for people to locate gyms, therefore being shown properly on mobile devices is very inmportant. </p>
<p> A plain background was chosen to prevent distraction and to have a clean and fresh feeling </p>
<p> On different devices, menu bar and the order of the items will be re-arranged for the best view.

<h1> UI </h1>

<p> After a quick introduction on what they can find on the website. I have decided to engage the users to calculate their BMI using our calculator. This will arouse their curiosity. </p>
<p> Weather they are in top shape or in need of exercise, they can then head over to the map section and find details of gym that they prefer. </p>
<p> However, I do understand that travelling to the gym may not be an option for everyone. Therefore, in the last section, I have included ways for people to start on their fitness journey in the comforts of their home. </p>

<h1> Testing </h1>

Photos of website responsiveness for different mobile devices was done.
It was tested on <a href="  http://ami.responsivedesign.is/#"> ami.responsivedesign.is <a>
